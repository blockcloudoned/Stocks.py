You're right, my apologies. Let's move on to identifying chart patterns. Recognizing these patterns programmatically is more complex than calculating indicators, but we can start with a simplified example. Libraries like patterndetect can help. However, for a robust solution, you'll likely need to implement custom algorithms or use machine learning.
Here's a basic example of how you might approach pattern detection. This example focuses on identifying a simplified "double bottom" pattern:
import pandas as pd

def find_double_bottom(data, window=10):
    """
    Finds a simplified double bottom pattern in the given data.

    Args:
        data (pd.Series): The stock price data.
        window (int): The number of periods to look back.

    Returns:
        list: A list of indices where the pattern is found.
    """
    bottoms = []
    for i in range(window, len(data)):
        window_data = data[i - window:i]
        min_indices = window_data.nsmallest(2).index
        if abs(min_indices[0] - min_indices[1]) > window / 2 and window_data[min_indices[0]] == window_data[min_indices[1]]:
            bottoms.append(i)
    return bottoms

# Assuming stock_data has a 'Close' column
double_bottom_indices = find_double_bottom(stock_data['Close'])
print(f"Double bottoms found at indices: {double_bottom_indices}")


Explanation:
 * find_double_bottom Function:
   * Takes stock price data (data) and a window size (window) as input.
   * Iterates through the data, looking at chunks of window periods.
   * Finds the two lowest prices within each window.
   * Checks if the two lowest prices are close in value and relatively far apart in time (to avoid just noise).
   * If the conditions are met, it considers it a double bottom and adds the index to the bottoms list.
 * Usage:
   * Calls find_double_bottom with your stock's closing prices.
   * Prints the indices where double bottoms were found.
Important Notes:
 * This is a very simplified example. Real-world pattern recognition requires much more complex algorithms and considerations.
 * For more complex pattern analysis, consider libraries designed for image recognition or machine learning to detect patterns in the graph itself.
 * You will need to refine this function, or create others, to detect other patterns.
Next, we can talk about visualizing these patterns and indicators. Would you like to proceed with visualization, or should we refine the pattern detection part further?
